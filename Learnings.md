**Learnings throughout the project**

* **Phase 1**
* Starting from what is Point of Interest Data(POI)
* 1 Working of Open Street map
* 2 What is QGIS and how does it works 
* 3 Getting familiar to the terminologies like **GIS data types** - vector and raster data.
* 4 Learned about convertion of **OSM** file to **CSV** , this can be either used using python script and osmium or using [MyGeoData](https://mygeodata.cloud/)
* 5 I learned about making vector layers in **QGIS** and applying clustering and statistical analysis.


**Issues Faced**
 * 1 for overpass API
 * 2 I could have used OSmium but right now I have a windows machine and Osmium doesn't supports windows [osmium](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/)
 * 3 Other than this , I could have opted for a bigger osm file but the data set given didn't allowed to store a large osm file.
 * 4 I tried performing these things on QGIS aswell , but system issues were there
